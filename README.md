# encryption-program
Small encryption program that uses the Hill Digraph cipher
I wrote this when I was very sick and bored, so it does not have much to it yet. I will add decrypting and options for the user to be able to choose what file they want to encrypt and make a small change to the program so that it can encrypt files with an odd number of characters
